"""The GT2 timing belt the three towers run, and what a pulley that
meshes on it has to be.

Carried over from Metamaquina 2's `gt2.py` (same author, same
workspace), where these restatements of molejo's wrap rule and tooth form
were first worked out against a real machine; the module docstring
there records what they found.  Nothing here is Kossel-specific: it is
what GT2 *is*.  What the Kossel's loops run on -- which circles, how
wide, where the carriage clamps -- arrives as arguments from `belt`.

molejo authors a belt as a `Wrap`: an ordered list of circles in the XY
plane, run along their external tangents, clockwise seen from +Z, with
the belt's width along +Z and the swept path being the belt's *pitch
line*.  The circles a wrap takes are pitch circles, so a contact radius
is converted differently for a toothed pulley (`on_pulley`) and a plain
bearing the tooth tips ride (`on_idler`); a clamp is anchored at a
distance *along* a tangent span, which `span_origin` and `span_scale`
convert a carriage position to; and a pulley's groove is the shape of
everything a tooth does on its way in and out (`groove`), cut from
molejo's own tooth form (`modulation`).
